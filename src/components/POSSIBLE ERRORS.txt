4. MonthlyCount.js
Purpose: Renders either AdminView or CountItems based on userType.
Analysis:
This component doesn’t directly query any tables.
It passes userType to AdminView or CountItems but doesn’t pass selectedLocation to either, which could cause the "No location selected" error you mentioned earlier.
No direct queries to weekly_counts_hstd, so it’s not the source of the error.
